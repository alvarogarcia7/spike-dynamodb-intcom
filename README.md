# IntCom DynamoDB spike

This is a **spike to integrate with DynamoDB** (saving, retrieving) using the high-level java bindings.

The goal of the spike has been achieved: a proof of concept to integrate with DynamoDB.
Now that we know that technically this is a feasible solution, we need to define the
specifications with the stakeholders.

## Tasks

### Running the database

Run the class `LocalDynamoDB`

No need to set up AWS credentials, as you're running it locally

### Running the tests

Run the class `FullCycleTest`
